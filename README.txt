Module provides a method of delivery "Econt Delivery" and method of payment
"Econt cash" for Ubercart2. When enabled and configured modules, upon
completion of the contract for completing the delivery address, the customer
has a choice of preferred options for delivery. Based on selected products,
shipping address and preferred delivery options, calculate the cost of delivery
of the order. In selected payment method "Econt COD" is automatically charged
the fee for this.
The calculation of the cost of delivery and cash on delivery fee is calculated
by the online system Econt. Then apply to your order at the online store.
